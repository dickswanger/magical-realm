--PREFACE--
Heya, /tg/. While I loved the original CYOA, the tedium of scrolling back and forth across multiple large images of "words, words, words" inspired me to create this interactive version.
There's still a lot of work to be done, and I will continue to update, improve, and extend the site as time permits - I look forward to your feedback and help in this regard. I'll try to keep an eye on CYOA threads, but I can be reached at cyoafeedback@gmail.com.
In the meantime, I hope you enjoy!

--INSTRUCTIONS--
The interface should be pretty intuitive, but there are a couple of points I'd like to highlight anyway:
- Your remaining baubles are tracked by a little red number in the bottom corner.
- The cost of an option is indicated by the bold number to the immediate left of the "Purchase"/"Refund" button.
- You can hide or show a section by clicking on the title.
- The generated summary will appear at the bottom of your screen, so you will need to scroll down to see it.
- You cannot revoke a choice you have rolled for.

--REQUIREMENTS--
